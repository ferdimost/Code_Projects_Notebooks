# Some deep learning exercises 

The files should give an overview of different used neuronal network architectures.
It contains examples of training and validating e.g. the datasets: MNIST, CIFAR.
Further keywords from the Deep Learning field, that are exemplarily treated here, are: 
Recurrent Neuronal Networks; LSTM; t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding; PCA whitening
