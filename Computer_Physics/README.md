# This is a collection of algorithms implemented in computational physics.

The file 'implemented_functions.py' is a collection of functions for solving standart linear algebra or analysis questions. 
Most of its functionalities are implemented in well performing functions of standart python packages. 
Here however, the focus is set to implement by-hand and through that to learn the basics of a range of those algorithms. 

The Exam file is showing two exemplary realizations of tasks. 
1.) An implementation of a Fast Fourier Transformation and validation on simple geometric forms; plus a image denoizing execution
2.) A simulation of foxes and rabbits that are initially positioned on a grid lattice. They reproduce, foxes eat rabbits, if they have an encounter etc.. A visual representation is given by a small animation at the end of the file, where the individual populations can be tracked.
-> This is an example of a small simulation of real-world processes that can be examined by a simulation under a given model
